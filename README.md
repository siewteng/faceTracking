# faceTracking
Move camera to be directed at the viewer's face

This project is done on the Raspberry Pi 4 with OpenCV. To use OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 4, do install Python 3.8 and get rid of Python 2 that was pre-installed in the pi.
The camera is attached to 2 servos (GPIO2 and GPIO13).

*we need to use 'sudo pigpiod' on the cmd in raspberry pi before the pigpiod library can be used in the code
